Hi, I'm Jared! ðŸ‘‹

I'm the **Head of Open Source at â–²[Vercel](https://vercel.com)** where I lead the [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js)/[React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte), [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack), and [Turborepo](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo) teams. I joined Vercel after they acquired my frontend build system startup Turborepo in late 2021. 

Prior to Vercel and Turborepo, I ran a software development and design studio in New York City called The Palmer Group. I'm mostly known for my open source projects in the React ecosystem such as [Formik](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik) and [TSDX](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/tsdx), which are trusted by millions of developers all over the world. 

I angel invest in early-stage startups that I'm passionate about. If I'm not working or tweeting, I'm likely skiing on the east coast, going to concerts, or hanging with friends.
